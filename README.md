TrackFolio is a real-time software application designed to help freelancers and business owners effectively manage their projects, clients, tasks, and team members for better company growth. 
Our motivation originated from recognizing a market void in which the present CRM applications fail to cater to the specific requirements of small business owners and freelancers. These apps are typically developed for bigger organizations. Therefore, to address this gap, we designed a tailored solution specifically targeting this niche group.
